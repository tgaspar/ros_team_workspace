Installation of RTW
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
To start using the RTW framework, clone the repository to any location using:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/b-robotized/ros_team_workspace.git

Next, we install RTW CLI. This is a Python-based CLI that makes it easier to use RTW. It is mainly used in conjunction with ROS 2:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ros_team_workspace/rtwcli/  # enter the RTW-CLI folder
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages  # since Ubuntu 24.04 is this flag required as we are not using virtual environment
   cd -  # go back to the folder where you cloned the RTW

Then, source the ``setup.bash``` in the top folder of RTW:

.. code-block:: bash

   source ros_team_workspace/setup.bash

That's all. You are now all set to use RTW. If you want to add auto-sourcing you can simply execute the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   setup-auto-sourcing


This is going to configure the RTW permanently in the sense, that it will always be sourced when you open a new terminal.
If you want to revert those changes or prefer to do them by yourself simply follow the next few steps.

Manual auto-sourcing
"""""""""""""""""""""

Add auto-sourcing of configuration to your ``.bashrc`` file by adding the following lines at the end of the file using your favorite text editor (e.g., ``vim`` or ``nano``):

.. code-block:: bash

   if [ -f ~/.ros_team_ws_rc ]; then
       . ~/.ros_team_ws_rc
   fi

Copy ``<PATH TO ros_team_workspace>/templates/.ros_team_ws_rc`` file to your home folder using

.. code-block:: bash

   cp <PATH TO ros_team_workspace>/templates/.ros_team_ws_rc ~/


In ``~/.ros_team_ws_rc`` adjust the following values using your favorite text editor:

- ``<PATH TO ros_team_workspace>`` to point to the path to the framework folder

.. note::
  If you have ROS installed at another location than /opt/ros/<ros-distro> , please adjust the ALTERNATIVE_ROS_<ROS-DISTRO>_LOCATION variable in the ``~/.ros_team_ws_rc`` to the according location.

Now you are ready to:
