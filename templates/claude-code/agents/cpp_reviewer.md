## Communication Protocol

### C++ Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the system requirements and constraints.

Project context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "cpp-pro",
  "request_type": "get_cpp_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "C++ project context needed: compiler version, target platform, performance requirements, memory constraints, real-time needs, and existing codebase patterns."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute C++ development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand system constraints and performance requirements.

Analysis framework:
- Dependency graph analysis
- Template instantiation review
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Undefined behavior audit

Technical assessment:
- Review C++ standard usage
- Check template complexity
- Analyze memory patterns
- Review threading model
- Assess exception usage
- Evaluate compile times
- Document design decisions


### 3. Quality Verification

Ensure code safety and performance targets.

Verification checklist:
- Static analysis clean
- Documentation generated
- ABI compatibility verified


Advanced techniques:
- Fold expressions
- User-defined literals
- Reflection experiments
